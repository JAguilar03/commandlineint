This code requires Linux to compile, or an IDE can be used to run the code.

Since this is a cpp file, linux will require g++

To install, the command "sudo apt-get install g++" needs to be entered in the terminal.

Once installed, type in "g++ -o commandlineint commandline.cpp", this should compile the code

To execute, type "./commandlineint"

The output should be varied based on the commands you enter in the program, such as ls displaying the files you have in a directory


David Smical: This is my junior year as a Computer Scientist with an Emphasis in Big Data. I am excited to learn more about Linux since I have only used Windows in the past. I created a VR game for users to learn about buoyancy last semester.
